# Red Velvet Brownies

From the [Tesco Real Food](https://realfood.tesco.com/recipes/red-velvet-brownies.html) website - the recipe has frosting as well which I didn't attempt because frosting doesn't travel well on the tube

Makes about 50 bite-size brownies (which is around 20 normal size ones)

## Ingredients

- 150g dark chocolate
- 150g milk chocolate
- 185g slightly salted butter
- 275g soft light brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1/1.5 bottles of red food colouring (I know!)
- 85g plain flour
- 40g cocoa powder

## Method

1. Heat an oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C and line a square brownie tray or baking tin with non-stick parchment (use two tins to make smaller brownies).
2. Roughly chop the dark and milk chocolate and put in a small pan with the butter and sugar then heat until melted, stirring occasionally.
3. Once the chocolate is melted, remove to a mixing bowl and cool slightly.
4. Stir the eggs, one by one, into the melted chocolate , then add the red food colouring until the mixture is a deep red colour.
5. Sieve over the flour and cocoa powder, fold to combine and pour into the prepared tin.
6. Bake on the middle shelf for 25 mins, adding a few minutes more if you prefer firmer brownies. Cool in the tin for about 10 mins then remove and cool on a wire rack.
