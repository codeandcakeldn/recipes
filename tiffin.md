# Jenny's Oreo Tiffin

## Ingredients

- Most of a packet of Oreos
- Some of a packet of digestives/chocolate digestives
- 100g unsalted butter
- 2 tbsp golden syrup
- 300-400g milk chocolate
- White chocolate for decoration (optional)

*Note:* You can swap the biscuits and chocolate for any combos you like (e.g. ginger biscuits and dark chocolate), or add extras like raisins or marshmallows into the mix.

## Method

1. Crush the biscuits (aim for about 250g in total, I usually do 150g Oreo, 100g digestives) - either by putting them in a sealed plastic food bag and bashing them with a rolling pin, or putting them in a blender.
2. Melt 200g of the chocolate and all of the butter in a microwave (or bowl over a saucepan of boiling water), and mix in the 2tbsp of golden syrup.
3. Add the biscuits to the melted mixture and stir until thoroughly mixed.
4. Spread mixture over the bottom of a baking tin lined with grease-proof paper or tin foil, and smooth flat with the back of a spoon.
5. Melt the remaining milk chocolate and white chocolate in separate bowls.
6. Pour the melted milk chocolate over the biscuit base, and smooth flat.
7. Drizzle the white chocolate in whatever pattern you fancy across the top (optional).
8. Refrigerate until solid (1-2 hrs, or overnight), then cut into squares.
